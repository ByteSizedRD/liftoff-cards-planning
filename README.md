# Liftoff Cards

## Overview

This is the repository for a project I'm making along with my group while mentoring Liftoff at LaunchCode. This project will serve as an example for the course, but will also help me expand my own skills, while experiencing the same struggles and triumps of the students in class.

Problem I'm solving: My family often plays cards together- and for some games, scoring is quite involved & easy to make mistakes. Additionally, we keep a running tally of wins for some games on a piece of paper, but would like to be able to keep track of more complex data.

Liftoff Cards is an App that will allow you to score your favorite card games, save scores, and view statistics.

## Features

This app will include user profiles, the ability to keep score for different types of games, detailed statistics, and data visualization.

## Technologies

React, Spring REST, PostgreSQL, Swagger, ChartJS

## What I'll Have to Learn

All of the technologies in this project are new to me.
