# Liftoff Cards

## Overview

This is the repository for a project I'm making along with my group while mentoring Liftoff at LaunchCode. This project will serve as an example for the course, but will also help me expand my own skills, while experiencing the same struggles and triumps of the students in class.

Problem I'm solving: My family often plays cards together- and for some games, scoring is quite involved & easy to make mistakes. Additionally, we keep a running tally of wins for some games on a piece of paper, but would like to be able to keep track of more complex data.

Liftoff Cards is an App that will allow you to score your favorite card games, save scores, and view statistics.

## Features

User Profiles: Each unique user will have a profile to store their name & game stats

Ability to score different games: This app will include the ability to score multiple games (Pinochle, Hearts, Ol' Shoot, Canasta)

Detailed Statitics: The app will store details statistics beyond just wins/losses. Examples: longest winning streak, highest overall score, etc.

Data Visualization: I will utilize a JS library to create data visualizations

## Technologies

React, Spring REST, PostgreSQL, Swagger, ChartJS

## What I'll Have to Learn

I have some experience with React and Spring, but all of these technologies are relatively new to me.
